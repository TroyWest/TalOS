# TalOS
TalOS is a hobby operating system I am using to learn about OS development. As such it is probably a mess but you are welcome to take a look.

TalOS has been built by using the information in various tutorials. The initial "Hello world" set up of the kernel was achieved by following the Bare Bones and Mety Skeleton tutorials from the OSDev Wiki.
